**DO ALL THE EXERCISES OF TODAY IN PURE PYTHON SCRIPTS WITH NO JUPYTER**

### Exercise 1:

Create a module that has a class called "Exercises". Let this class have 9 functions called "ex1, ex2.., ex9". Put all your exercises of Day 1 into those functions. Then in a main script run them all.

#### Exercise 2:
Create your own class for complex numbers. Make sure all the arithmetic operations work and that you can print it.

#### Exercise 3:
Create a "wrapper class" for around numpy array for operations on matrices. You should be able to execute the following code:

```
N=4
matrix1=MyMatrix(N) #creates a square matrix
matrix2=MyMatrix(N)
print(matrix1.inverse())
print(matrix1.determinant())
print(matrix1.eigenvalues())
print(matrix1+matrix2)
print(matrix1*matrix2)
```
